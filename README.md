# impacket-script
**Impacket** is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. It is particularly useful for penetration testing and security assessments. Hereâ€™s how to use some of its key features and scripts.

### Installation

Impacket can be installed on Kali Linux using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install impacket-scripts
```

### Common Impacket Scripts and Usage

#### 1. `wmic`

**Description:** This script allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows machine using WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).

**Usage:**

```bash
wmic -target <target_ip> -username <username> -password <password> <command>
```

**Example:**

```bash
wmic -target 192.168.1.100 -username Administrator -password password123 "process call create calc.exe"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Process created successfully with ID: 1234
```

#### 2. `smbclient`

**Description:** This script allows you to access SMB shares on remote machines.

**Usage:**

```bash
smbclient -M <target_ip> -U <username>
```

**Example:**

```bash
smbclient -M 192.168.1.100 -U Administrator
```

**Expected Output:**

```
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE
```

#### 3. `psexec`

**Description:** This script allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows machine using SMB.

**Usage:**

```bash
psexec -target <target_ip> -username <username> -password <password> <command>
```

**Example:**

```bash
psexec -target 192.168.1.100 -username Administrator -password password123 cmd.exe
```

**Expected Output:**

```
* Connecting to 192.168.1.100
* Executing command: cmd.exe
```

#### 4. `ntlmrelayx`

**Description:** This script relays NTLM authentication to other services.

**Usage:**

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -t <target_service> -smb2support
```

**Example:**

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -t http://192.168.1.100/
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[*] Listening for connections on port 80
```

### Important Considerations

- **Legal Use:** Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you are targeting. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
- **Network Configuration:** Ensure that your network settings allow for the necessary traffic between your machine and the target.

### Conclusion

Impacket provides a powerful suite of tools for network protocol manipulation and exploitation. By understanding its various scripts and options, you can effectively perform security assessments and penetration testing. Always use these tools responsibly and within legal boundaries.

**Impacket** is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols, primarily used for penetration testing and security assessments. You can use it to perform various tasks, including SMB, NetBIOS, and others.

### Installation

To install Impacket on Kali Linux, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install impacket-scripts
```

### Common Impacket Scripts and Usage Examples

#### 1. `wmic`

This script allows you to execute commands on remote Windows machines using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

**Usage:**

```bash
impacket-wmic <target_ip> <username> <password> "command"
```

**Example:**

```bash
impacket-wmic 192.168.1.100 Administrator P@ssw0rd "whoami"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Administrator
```

#### 2. `smbclient`

This script allows you to interact with SMB shares on a target machine.

**Usage:**

```bash
impacket-smbclient //<target_ip>/<share> -U <username>
```

**Example:**

```bash
impacket-smbclient //192.168.1.100/share -U Administrator
```

**Expected Output:**

```
You are now connected to the share!
```

#### 3. `mimikatz`

This script can be used to extract credentials from memory.

**Usage:**

```bash
impacket-mimikatz -i <target_ip> -u <username> -p <password>
```

**Example:**

```bash
impacket-mimikatz -i 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p P@ssw0rd
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Kerberos: 
  Username: Administrator
  Password: P@ssw0rd
```

#### 4. `ntlmrelayx`

This script is used for NTLM relay attacks. It relays authentication requests to other services.

**Usage:**

```bash
impacket-ntlmrelayx -t <target>
```

**Example:**

```bash
impacket-ntlmrelayx -t http://192.168.1.100
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Relaying NTLM authentication...
```

### Important Considerations

- **Legal Use**: Always ensure you have permission to test the target systems. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
- **Network Settings**: Ensure that the target systems are reachable and have the necessary services running.
- **Dependencies**: Some scripts may require additional dependencies or configurations, so refer to the Impacket documentation for specific requirements.

### Conclusion

Impacket is a powerful tool for network protocol analysis and exploitation. By understanding its various scripts and commands, you can effectively perform penetration tests and security assessments. Always use these tools responsibly and within legal boundaries.


                  ALTERNATIVE
Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols, and it's a powerful tool for penetration testing and exploitation. Impacket scripts are a part of the Kali Linux distribution.

Here's an overview of how to use Impacket scripts and some examples:

**Impacket Scripts:**

Impacket scripts are Python scripts that utilize the Impacket library to interact with various network protocols. These scripts can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

* Enumerating shares and files on a remote system
* Executing commands on a remote system
* Transferring files to and from a remote system
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in network services

**Using Impacket Scripts:**

To use an Impacket script, you'll need to have Impacket installed on your system. If you're using Kali Linux, Impacket is already included. Otherwise, you can install it using pip: `pip install impacket`

Once you have Impacket installed, you can run the scripts using Python. For example, to run the `smbclient.py` script, you would use the following command: `python /usr/share/doc/impacket/examples/smbclient.py`

**Examples:**

Here are a few examples of Impacket scripts and their usage:

#### 1. Enumerating Shares with `smbclient.py`

```
python /usr/share/doc/impacket/examples/smbclient.py -target-ip 192.168.1.100 -username administrator -password password123
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Shares:
  - ADMIN$
  - C$
  - IPC$
  - NETLOGON
  - SYSVOL
```

This script enumerates the shares on the target system and displays them.

#### 2. Executing a Command with `wmiexec.py`

```
python /usr/share/doc/impacket/examples/wmiexec.py -target-ip 192.168.1.100 -username administrator -password password123 -command "whoami"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
nt authority\system
```

This script executes the `whoami` command on the target system and displays the result.

#### 3. Transferring a File with `smbclient.py`

```
python /usr/share/doc/impacket/examples/smbclient.py -target-ip 192.168.1.100 -username administrator -password password123 -put /local/path/to/file.txt C:\remote\path\to\file.txt
```

This script uploads a file from the local system to the remote system.

**Important Considerations:**

* Always ensure you have permission to access the target system.
* Use strong passwords and credentials to avoid unauthorized access.
* Be cautious when using Impacket scripts to avoid overwhelming the target system or your own system.

Remember to use Impacket scripts responsibly and within the bounds of the law.
